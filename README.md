My FreeCad &amp; FabLab experiences to share for improvement

# ToDo
  - Improve this manual ;-)
  - Export views in techdrawpage to .dxf doesn't work for all views.
  - Making offset with arc-corners with 2D approach (see macro code) doesn't work.
  - Auto cleanup afterwards, if necessary.
  - Test/debug other shapes.
