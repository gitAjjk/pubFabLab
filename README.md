# pubFabLab
Here my **FreeCad** & **FabLab** experiences.  
Feel free to use this lifehacks and share your improvements & suggestions with me.

See [ajOffset.FCStd](https://github.com/gitAjjk/pubFabLab/blob/main/ajOffset.FCStd) for examples of dovetail-sliced polar patterns with pockets.

## ToDo with ajOffset.FCMacro.py :
  - Improve this manual ;-)
  - Export views in techdrawpage to .dxf doesn't work for all views.
  - Making offset with arc-corners with 2D approach (see macro code) doesn't work.
  - Auto cleanup afterwards, if necessary.
  - Test/debug other shapes.
