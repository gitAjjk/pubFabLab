Create dybamic techdraw with all lines moved 1/2 kerf. outerlines placed to outside, inner lines smaller    
Put **ajOffset.FCMacro.py** in C:/Users/AjArn24/Dropbox/Freecad/MACROS/  
Usage:  
- select objects  
- menu > macro > Macros... > ajOffset.FCMacro.py
- Set kerf

Beware the kerf offset lines don't cross other lines. This happens when two lines have less than 'kerf' distance in sketch.
